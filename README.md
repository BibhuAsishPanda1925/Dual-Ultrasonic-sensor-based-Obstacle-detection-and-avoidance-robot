ðŸ”„ **Algorithm for ESP32-Based Obstacle Avoidance Robot**

**1. Initialization**

* Begin serial communication.
* Configure GPIO pins for ultrasonic sensors, motor drivers, and servo motor.
* Attach servo motor and set it to the default forward-facing angle.
* Set the robotâ€™s movement state to "moving forward".

---

**2. Main Loop Execution**

**A. If the robot is moving forward:**

1. **Measure front distance** using the forward-facing ultrasonic sensor.
2. **If obstacle is detected** (distance < 30 cm):

   * Stop the robot.
   * Rotate the front sensor to the right.
   * Read distance using the **rear sensor** (assumed facing right due to servo rotation).
   * Read distance again using **front sensor** (assumed now facing left).
   * Compare left and right distances:

     * If **left is clear** and **right is blocked**, turn left.
     * If **right is clear** and **left is blocked**, turn right.
     * If **both sides are clear**, turn toward the side with **more space**.
     * If **both sides are blocked**, move backward.
   * After decision, stop, reset servo to center, and resume moving forward.
3. **If no obstacle**, continue moving forward.

**B. If the robot is moving backward:**

1. **Measure back distance** using the rear ultrasonic sensor.
2. **If obstacle is detected** behind (distance < 30 cm):

   * Stop the robot.
   * Rotate front sensor to right.
   * Read distances from both sensors.
   * Compare:

     * If **left is clear** and **right is blocked**, turn left.
     * If **right is clear** and **left is blocked**, turn right.
     * If **both sides are clear**, turn toward the side with **more distance**.
     * If **both sides are blocked**, stop and move forward.
   * After decision, stop, reset servo to center, and resume moving backward.
3. **If no obstacle**, continue moving backward.

---

**3. Loop Continuation**

* Add a small delay at the end of each cycle.
* Repeat the entire loop continuously to maintain obstacle awareness.
