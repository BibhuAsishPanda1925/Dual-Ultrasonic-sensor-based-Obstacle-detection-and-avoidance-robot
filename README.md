# Dual-Ultrasonic-sensor-based-Obstacle-detection-and-avoidance-robot

## üîå Hardware List
- ESP32 Dev Board
- 2x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
- L298N Motor Driver
- 4x 100rpm DC motors
- Servo Motor (SG90 or equivalent)
- IC7805 voltage regulator (mandatory for voltage supply to sensors from voltage source)
- Robot chassis and wheels
- Battery pack

This project contains the code and design for an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot using:
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Stepper motor for front-back-left-right scanning
- Dual ultrasonic sensors for front-back scanning when servo at 0 degrees and left-right scanning when servo at 90 degrees
- DC motors with L298n motor drivers
